# My Hello World Chrome Extension


## About <a name = "about"></a>

This extension was made using the first 26 videos from this collection of tutorial videos: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ac6kaow09A&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwg2-q6Kvw3Tl_4xhxtIaNlY&index=27).  

Nothing too special about this project since I followed a video series, other than the fact that I converted it to work with firefox while I was following along. Just sayin!
